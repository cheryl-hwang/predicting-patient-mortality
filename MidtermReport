#Midterm Report  


##Introduction/Background  
The need for intensive care unit (ICU) patient care expands each year (3). One of the greatest issues that ICU clinicians face is treating and monitoring acutely ill patients (3). 

##Problem definition 
Patients in the ICU must be treated based on the level of risk of mortality for the patient, but there is no universal way to test this between patients with different ailments. We will create a model that predicts mortality in ICU patients by assessing their level III APACHE score for various diagnostic bodies. With this model, clinicians will have a single metric to use to assess risk levels. 

##Data Collection 
This dataset includes the electronic health record data of 250,000 patients from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (ANZICS-APD) and 130,000 patients from the US eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) (1) summarized by APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) data grouped by diagnosis bodies (e.g., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, etc.). The data collected reflects the patientâ€™s first 24 hours stay in the ICU and is labelled by patient mortality. 
Prior to data cleaning, there are 91,713 entries, each corresponding to a unique patient encounter, and 186 features.
